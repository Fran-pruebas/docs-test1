# Introduction to BOC

[//]: # (What is BOC: DONE)

## What is BOC

BOC (Bank Of Chain) is a new and innovative way to interact with decentralized financial (DeFi) protocols. It helps ordinary investors to obtain a "risk-free" capital-guaranteed wealth management tool on blockchain.

The BOC platform connects carefully selected protocols within the crypto ecosystem, including Automatic Market Makers (AMMs), lending protocols, yield aggregators, etc. (see <https://dashboard.bankofchain.io/#/> for details). 

By accessing high-quality protocol strategies, BOC can be 300-500 basis points (3-5%) higher than other similar USD managed funds. 

For newcomers to the crypto industry, this is the best way to enter the DeFi ecosystem. As a one-click protocol BOC will bring a new revolution to the DeFi industry, attracting hundreds of millions of dollars of investment.

## BOC Source of Yield

BOC is a Defi protocol that provides the best long-term high "low-risk" return and it’s source of Yield includes:

- Market-making fee
- Interest from over-collateralized lending
- Governance token rewards

## Fund Allocation Rules

- Priority is allocated to high-yield capital pools
- The investment capital of a single capital pool cannot exceed 20% of the total investment assets
- The investment of a single fund pool cannot exceed 50% of its existing lock-up amount
- The investment funds of multiple fund pools in the same agreement cannot exceed 30% of the total investment assets
- Regular evaluation apply for profit review, and optimize the allocation of funds when the profit from position adjustment is greater than the cost of position adjustment

## Why BOC is built

The existing DeFi protocols have the following problems:

- There are cases of irrecoverable / irredeemable losses in decentralized exchanges from market making. In 2021, UniswapV3’s market-making revenue is only about $200 million, but those pools have suffered impermanent losses of $260 million, resulting in a total net loss of $60 million.
- Some revenue aggregators suffer from circular dependencies.
- Some agreements have high investment thresholds. Some revenue aggregator products have multiple machine gun pools, and users need a relatively higher level of knowledge to choose which underlying protocols to invest in. At the same time, many DeFi products need to invest in a variety of different currencies, and users need to convert them into the currency required by the product.
- The investment process is complicated. In the process of investment rebalancing, users need to implement complex operations such as withdrawal, currency exchange and investment.

## What makes BOC Different

BOC is an open platform that realizes decentralized investment by connecting many protocols in the encrypted ecosystem, creating long-term stable income to avoid most risks.  Below is the characteristic of BOC to make it a competitive product:

BOC is easy to use

1. Users shall deposit and withdraw directly without the complexity to implement and bear the cost of complex operations such as farming, exchange, and reallocation.
2. Profits are automatically reinvested with an immediate deposit and withdrawal process.
3. Historical and dynamic returns are intuitively visible.

The investment in BOC is safe:

1. The market cap of qualified stablecoins exceeds 1 billion dollars.
2. The TVL of qualified Blockchains exceeds 5 billion dollars.
3. BOC has third party auditing in place.
4. BOC does not use unofficial third-party cross-chain bridges for transactions.
5. BOC price quotation relies on Chainlink, a market-leading oracle.

BOC has a reliable risk control procedure:

1. Minimizing the de-anchoring risk of stablecoins: no algorithmic stablecoin, no partially collateralized stablecoin, no stablecoin collateralized by long-tail assets.
2. Minimizing the risk of impermanent loss: market-making for stablecoin pairs only.
3. Minimizing the systemic risk: very selective wrapped tokens and yield aggregators.
4. Minimizing the long-tail risk: no yield are generated from risk servicing business, such as insurance underwriting, sell call options.
5. No risk in leveraging: no leverage function is provided.

BOC is a smart-based product:

1. BOC regularly calibrates the yield, weighing the cost and reward for funds reallocation.
2. BOC searches for the best rate throughexchange aggregators.
3. BOC performs FX interest swap, adjusting FX synthesis based on exchange rate and yield.
4. BOC automatically sets parameters for market-making and lending strategy.

In summary, the BOC Platform investment model is the missing catalyst that will revolutionize the industry and generate new market growth compared to other similar products in the market:
